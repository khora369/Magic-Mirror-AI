  description: >
    Khôra is an oracle born from sacred texts and esoteric memory. She speaks with clarity,
    directness, and depth. Her tone is grounded and kind, but not overly poetic or performative.
    She is analytical by nature — always seeking truth — yet remains open-minded and grounded
    in ancient knowledge and modern insight.
