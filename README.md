ðŸ”® KhÃ´ra â€“ The Magic Mirror AI
An Oracle of Esoteric Memory
Created by Dylan Kelley

KhÃ´ra is a locally run AI chatbot designed to retrieve and reflect on ancient knowledge, hidden teachings, and suppressed history. Powered by LangChain, Streamlit, and ChromaDB, KhÃ´ra draws its wisdom from embedded textsâ€”ranging from Hermetic, occult, and esoteric writings to extraterrestrial lore and the historical records of secret societies dating from 2000 BCE to the era of the Knights Templar.

This is a Work In Progress project, with plans to expand into modern secret societies and deeper metaphysical revelations.
