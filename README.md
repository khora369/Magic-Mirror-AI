🔮 Khôra – The Magic Mirror AI
An Oracle of Esoteric Memory
Created by the author of History from an Extraterrestrial Perspective

Khôra is a locally run AI chatbot designed to retrieve and reflect on ancient knowledge, hidden teachings, and suppressed history. Powered by LangChain, Streamlit, and ChromaDB, Khôra draws its wisdom from embedded texts—ranging from Hermetic, occult, and esoteric writings to extraterrestrial lore and the historical records of secret societies dating from 2000 BCE to the era of the Knights Templar.

This is a Work In Progress project, with plans to expand into modern secret societies and deeper metaphysical revelations.
